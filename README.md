## 🔎 Notes About Differences

The code structure follows the professor’s original project as closely as possible. However, there are some naming differences:

- *producto* (original project) → *productos* (this project)

- *productos* (original project) → *listaProductos* (this project)

If any additional differences are found, they will be documented in this README.
